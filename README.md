# Starry

## Why Choose Starry?
- Starry is free, and completely open-source.
- Starry will be up almost *24/7*
- In the event of a new update, Starry will be *disabled* for a few hours, preventing bans.

## Alternatives
Starry will most likely *NOT* be as overpowered as other menus, such as
- ShibaGT Genesis (https://discord.gg/shibagtgenesis)
- Destiny (https://discord.gg/vmprotect)
- Possibly others.
